# Tiny-compiler
I tried making a very very small simple compiler to understand the basics of it.
I have been interested in making a bigger scale compiler that can perform more complex operations
and this is the start of it. This mini compiler can only give one output as I have taken in only one easy input.
The input can be changed in the code tself.
